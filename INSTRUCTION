1. install virtualenv
    https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#InstallingVirtualenv
    follow step 1 and 2 for installation,
    to activate your virtualenv type commands as in step 3
    to deactivate type "deactivate"

    since each user may install different modules, which may cause tangled dependency
    using virtualenv, users can handle the necessary modules by themselves without 
    influence on others
    
    activate your virtualenv before invoke script.py, if any module needed to be installed
    type "pip install <module-name>" to install

2. git clone https://github.com/p20120531/String-Length-Analyzer.git
    type "git branch" to identify the current branch
    switch to "parse_remake" branch by "git checkout parse_remake"

    to compile the executable, type "make" in src/ directory, 
    the default path of the executable is bin/sla

3. cp /users/p20120531/sla/bin/* < the "bin" directory in your clone >

4. add following lines in your ~/.bashrc 

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH="< the absolute path of the "bin" directory in your clone >/lib"
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH="< the absolute path of the "bin" directory in your clone >/z3-z3-4.4.1.0/build":$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    PATH="< the absolute path of the "bin" directory in your clone >/z3-z3-4.4.1.0/build/":$PATH
    export PATH

5. type "script.py --h" to get help information
